# Welcome

A website project I'm using to learn full stack development. Every function that has been added was added with a purpose of learning something new.

Currently there're two pages - an "About" page, and a "Check list" page.

The "About" page will simply have some text about the website, how to use, etc.

The "Check list" page has a check list where you can add a new task to the list, edit it, delete it, mark it as completed. The tasks are saved in MySQL database.

To launch this application you will need to set up MySQL with database named "checklist".

## Technology used
