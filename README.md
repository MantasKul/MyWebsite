# Welcome

A website project I'm using to learn full stack development. Every function that has been added was added with a purpose of learning something new.

Currently there're two pages - an "About" page, and a "Check list" page.

The "About" page will simply have some text about the website, how to use, etc.

The "Check list" page has a check list where you can add a new task to the list, edit it, delete it, mark it as completed. The tasks are saved in MySQL database.

To launch this application you will need to set up MySQL with database named "checklist".

## Technology used

Back end: Spring Boot

Front end: Angular

Database: MySQL

## Future plans

- After changing the table to use material table sorting isn't working anymore, fix that
- Improve overall styling, at the moment table's editing (priority drop-down and task input field) are not using material variation and doesn't fit the style. Change either styling or use material variation for those parts so it would fit
