# Welcome

A website project I'm using to learn full-stack development. Every function that has been added was added with the purpose of learning something new.

Currently, there are two pages - an "About" page, and a "Checklist" page.

The "About" page will have some text about the website, how to use it, etc.

The "Checklist" page has a checklist where you can add a new task to the list, edit it, delete it, or mark it as completed. The tasks are saved in the MySQL database.

To launch this application you will need to set up MySQL with a database named "checklist".

## Technology used
